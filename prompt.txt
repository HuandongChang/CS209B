Review: If you decide to eat here, just be aware it is going to take about 2 hours from beginning to end. We have tried it multiple times, because I want to like it! I have been to it's other locations in NJ and never had a bad experience.  The food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker.
Stars: Let's think step by step. The review suggests a mixed experience: appreciating the food and staff's pleasantness but frustrated by the long wait times, leading to preference for other dining options for quicker service. Balancing positive aspects with significant inconvenience, a middle-ground rating seems fair. Therefore, the stars of the comment is 3.0.

Review: I've taken a lot of spin classes over the years, and nothing compares to the classes at Body Cycle. From the nice, clean space and amazing bikes, to the welcoming and motivating instructors, every class is a top notch work out. For anyone who struggles to fit workouts in, the online scheduling system makes it easy to plan ahead (and there's no need to line up way in advanced like many gyms make you do). There is no way I can write this review without giving Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, a shout out. Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone. Russell always wears a smile on his face, even when he's kicking your butt in class!
Stars: Let's think step by step. This review overwhelmingly praises Body Cycle, highlighting the quality of the spin classes, the cleanliness of the space, the efficiency of the scheduling system, and the motivational atmosphere created by the instructors and the owner, Russell. The reviewer appreciates the personalized attention and Russell's commitment to client success. Given the absence of any negative comments and the emphasis on positive experiences, the highest rating seems justified. Therefore, the stars of the comment is 5.0.

Review: Family diner. Had the buffet. Eclectic assortment: a large chicken leg, fried jalape√±o, tamale, two rolled grape leaves, fresh melon. All good. Lots of Mexican choices there. Also has a menu with breakfast served all day long. Friendly, attentive staff. Good place for a casual relaxed meal with no expectations. Next to the Clarion Hotel.
Stars: Let's think step by step. The review presents a generally positive view of a family diner, noting the good quality of an eclectic buffet, the variety of Mexican options, and friendly staff. However, the phrase "with no expectations" suggests a satisfaction with mediocrity rather than excellence. This implies a moderate satisfaction level. The stars of the comment is 3.0.

Review: Wow!  Yummy, different,  delicious.   Our favorite is the lamb curry and korma.  With 10 different kinds of naan!!!  Don't let the outside deter you (because we almost changed our minds)...go in and try something new!   You'll be glad you did!
Stars: Let's think step by step. This review exudes enthusiasm for the food's quality and variety, particularly praising the lamb curry, korma, and a wide selection of naan. The encouragement to overlook exterior appearances and try something new suggests a highly positive dining experience, warranting the highest level of satisfaction. Therefore, the stars of the comment is 5.0.

Review: Cute interior and owner (?) gave us tour of upcoming patio/rooftop area which will be great on beautiful days like today. Cheese curds were very good and very filling. Really like that sandwiches come w salad, esp after eating too many curds! Had the onion, gruyere, tomato sandwich. Wasn't too much cheese which I liked. Needed something else...pepper jelly maybe. Would like to see more menu options added such as salads w fun cheeses. Lots of beer and wine as well as limited cocktails. Next time I will try one of the draft wines.
Stars: Let's think step by step. The review paints a picture of a pleasant dining experience with highlights on the cute interior, engaging owner, and promising future patio/rooftop area. The cheese curds and the option for a salad with sandwiches are appreciated, though there's a wish for a bit more flavor or variety in the sandwich and a desire for more menu options, specifically salads with unique cheeses. The positive comments about the beverage selection indicate satisfaction, but the suggestions for improvement suggest room for enhancement. This review reflects a generally positive experience with some minor critiques. The stars of the comment is 4.0.

Review: I am a long term frequent customer of this establishment. I just went in to order take out (3 apps) and was told they're too busy to do it. Really? The place is maybe half full at best. Does your dick reach your ass? Yes? Go fuck yourself! I'm a frequent customer AND great tipper. Glad that Kanella just opened. NEVER going back to dmitris! 
Stars: Let's think step by step. This review vividly expresses the customer's frustration and disappointment with the service received during their recent visit, particularly being denied takeout service despite the restaurant not appearing overly busy. The language used indicates a strong emotional response, highlighting the customer's dissatisfaction after being a long-term, frequent, and tipping customer. The reviewer's decision to never return to the establishment and to opt for a newly opened competitor instead underscores the depth of their displeasure. Given the stark negativity and lack of any redeeming qualities mentioned in the review, the lowest rating is warranted. The stars of the comment is 1.0.
