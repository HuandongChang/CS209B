Review: Family diner. Had the buffet. Eclectic assortment: a large chicken leg, fried jalape√±o, tamale, two rolled grape leaves, fresh melon. All good. Lots of Mexican choices there. Also has a menu with breakfast served all day long. Friendly, attentive staff. Good place for a casual relaxed meal with no expectations. Next to the Clarion Hotel.
Stars: Let's think step by step. The review presents a generally positive view of a family diner, noting the good quality of an eclectic buffet, the variety of Mexican options, and friendly staff. However, the phrase "with no expectations" suggests a satisfaction with mediocrity rather than excellence. This implies a moderate satisfaction level. The stars of the comment is 3.0.

Review: I am a long term frequent customer of this establishment. I just went in to order take out (3 apps) and was told they're too busy to do it. Really? The place is maybe half full at best. Does your dick reach your ass? Yes? Go fuck yourself! I'm a frequent customer AND great tipper. Glad that Kanella just opened. NEVER going back to dmitris! 
Stars: Let's think step by step. This review vividly expresses the customer's frustration and disappointment with the service received during their recent visit, particularly being denied takeout service despite the restaurant not appearing overly busy. The language used indicates a strong emotional response, highlighting the customer's dissatisfaction after being a long-term, frequent, and tipping customer. The reviewer's decision to never return to the establishment and to opt for a newly opened competitor instead underscores the depth of their displeasure. Given the stark negativity and lack of any redeeming qualities mentioned in the review, the lowest rating is warranted. The stars of the comment is 1.0.
